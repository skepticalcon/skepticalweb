      <div><img src="assets/img/speakers-2012/JoeyFabian2012.jpg" /><p>Drawing a picture of Santa Claus with a rocket booster attached to his sleigh, 6 year old <strong>Joey Fabian</strong> could say this was his first "skeptical moment". He eventually gave up drawing pictures for the bass guitar, but the skepticism has remained.</p>

      <p>He has many years of experience performing and recording. Joey has been the bass instructor at Gryphon Stringed Instruments in Palo Alto since 1994, in addition to running a small production studio in Menlo Park known as The Tomato Farm. He has shared the stage or recorded with Bartron Tyler Group, Alana Davis, Mumblefinger, Chris Rossbach, Will Ray, Nir Z, Celso Alberti, Michael Zanabili, Huge., Drew Youngs Trio, Ronny Crawford, Ashia, Paolo Baldi, Bole Bantu, Hershel Yatovich, Jack Chernos, Tony Stead, Garrick Davis and others.

      <div><img src="assets/img/speakers-2012/JonnyZavant2012_1.jpg" /><p><strong>Jonny Zavant</strong> began handling applications and designing testing protocol for James Randi's $1,000,000 Paranormal Challenge in 2003. Since then Jonny has become an internationally touring mentalist, speaker, lecturer, and author. His demonstrations of "Subliminal Entertainment" defy the power of reason; not to mention common sense. Jonny reveals secrets, forecasts the future, and demonstrates X-Ray vision in a show consistently recognized for his creative approach to entertaining. Jonny prefers to share the spotlight with the audience. Volunteers perform feats including lightning fast mathematics and mind-to-mind communication. Jonny performs at corporate events, colleges, fundraisers, and soirees. His talents have taken him around the world, including South Korea where he entertained United State Troops. (He's also intensely proud to be left handed.)</p></div>
      <div><img src="assets/img/speakers-2012/KernanColeman2012.jpg" /><p><strong>Kernan Coleman</strong> is the creative director at Ranch7 Creative in Santa Rosa, California (ranch7.com). As a child he was equally fascinated by science and the arts, and began drawing spaceships, cars and monsters before he could even walk. Career-wise, art won out (seeing as you have at least know your times tables to do science) and art meant a higher education fraught with unintentionally hilarious postmodernism (even at UCSD). This led to a decade-and-a-half dalliance with pseudoscientific, magical-thinking. He got better. His escape from Wooville is the stuff of legend and will soon be a major motion picture . . . okay, not really, but he does have some awesome stories of new age nuttery with which he will gladly regale you over a dram of sinlge malt. He is still somewhat stunned that he gets to work on an almost daily basis with many of his heroes of science and skepticism through his work with SkeptiCal and the James Randi Educational Foundation.</p></div>
      <div><img src="assets/img/speakers-2012/Kiki_03_01_05_197.jpg" /><p><strong>Dr. Kiki Sanford</strong> is dedicated to making science accessible.</p>
